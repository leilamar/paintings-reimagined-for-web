# Drawing on the Web: Final Project Outline
### Leila Mardoum
For my final project, I reimagined three of my favorite paintings as full browser web drawings. I wanted to strip the paintings down to their essential components and manipulate those components through CSS animation. The idea is to see the paintings distilled and in a digital context and to see what kind of effect the fragmentation of the work has on the impression of the painting as a whole. I have incorporated audio elements and other outside materials that pair well with the painting. It’s my hope that these animations and additional components will not only help bring the paintings to life, but also make them something different than they are in the museums. 

I am a big art history fan and am always looking for ways to combine my passion for art and technology and explore ways in which the two can interact. While a whole new sector of digital art has been developing, I find it exciting to bring older paintings that were made before digital art existed into a new space. The three paintings I want to reimagine are:

__“Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog” by Caspar David Friedrich__

__“The Swing” by Jean-Honoré Fragonard__

__“Mountain at Collioure” by Andre Derain__

The navigation is a gallery space that holds the original versions of the paintings; when you click on the original painting, you will be taken to the corresponding web drawing. It reminds me of Super Mario 64 where you navigate to different lands through the different paintings in Peach’s Castle. When you hover over one painting, the others fade and the background changes corresponding the painting with which you are interacting.
